Q Questions
An organization has a process whereby security-related hazards are identified, followed by analysis and decisions about what to do about these hazards. What kind of a business process is this?

Vulnerability management

Risk treatment

Risk management

Risk assessment

   C. The risk management process consists of risk assessments, analysis about risks that are identified by risk assessment, followed by discussions, and finally decisions about what to do about these risks.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the steps in the question do not describe a vulnerability management process. B is incorrect because the steps in the question do not describe a risk treatment process. However, risk treatment is a part of the risk management process. D is incorrect because the steps in the question do not describe a risk management process. Risk assessment is a part of the risk management process.

What is the purpose of a cyber-risk management program in an organization?

Consume information from a centralized risk register

Identify and make decisions about information security risks

Plan for future cybersecurity projects and initiatives

Develop mitigating controls

   B. The purpose of a cyber-risk management program is to use various means to identify information- and technology-related risks in an organization and then study and make decisions about those risks through a process known as risk treatment.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the purpose of a risk management program is not to consume information from the risk register, but instead to populate it and manage information there. C is incorrect because the core purpose of risk management is not long-term planning, but the management of risk. An output of the risk treatment process is a series of decisions that may result in one or more initiatives and projects to take place in the future. D is incorrect because this is too narrow a definition of risk management; while mitigating controls will sometimes be developed as a result of risk management, there are other outcomes as well.

All of the following activities are typical inputs into a risk management process except which one?

Code reviews

Risk assessments

Threat assessments

Internal audits

   A. A code review is not a typical input to a risk management process, primarily because a code review represents a narrow, tactical examination of a program’s source code. Output from a code review would likely be fed into a software defect tracking process or a vulnerability management process.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. They are incorrect because risk assessments, threat assessments, and internal audits would typically result in issues being processed by a risk management process. The distinction is this: A standard risk management process is designed to tackle cyber risks that are systemic in an organization. Examples of such risks include weaknesses in business processes and overarching design problems in complex information systems. Issues such as missing patches, security configuration problems, and software vulnerabilities are instead handled by tactical vulnerability management and software defect management processes.

What should be the primary objective of a risk management strategy?

Determine the organization’s risk appetite.

Identify credible risks and transfer them to an external party.

Identify credible risks and reduce them to an acceptable level.

Eliminate credible risks.

   C. The primary objective of a risk management strategy is the identification of risks, followed by the reduction of those risks to levels acceptable to executive management.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the determination of risk appetite, while important—and essential to the proper functioning of a risk management program—is not the main purpose of a risk management strategy. B is incorrect because transferring risks to external parties is but one of several possible outcomes for risks that are identified. D is incorrect because risks cannot be eliminated, only reduced to acceptable levels.

Marie, a CISO at a manufacturing company, is building a new cyber-risk governance process. For this process to be successful, what is the best first step for Marie to take?

Develop a RACI matrix that defines executive roles and responsibilities.

Charter a security steering committee consisting of IT and cybersecurity leaders.

Develop a risk management process similar to what is found in ISO/IEC 27001.

Charter a security steering committee consisting of IT, security, and business leaders.

   D. The best course of action is the formation of a chartered information security steering committee that consists of IT and security leaders, as well as business leaders. For security governance to succeed, business leaders need to be involved and participate in discussions and decisions.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because a RACI matrix, while important, is but a small part of a chartered information security steering committee. B is incorrect because a security steering committee must include business leaders. C is incorrect because this question is about security governance, which is more than just a risk management process.

An organization’s internal audit department is assessing the organization’s compliance with PCI DSS. Internal audit finds that the organization is not compliant with a PCI DSS control regarding workers’ annual acknowledgement of security policy. What kind of a risk has been identified?

Insider threat risk

Disclosure risk

Compliance risk

Administrative risk

   C. This is primarily a matter of compliance risk. Organizations handling credit card data are required to comply with all controls in PCI DSS, whether they represent actual risks or not.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. These are not the appropriate terms for this type of risk. In addition to risks related to information theft, disclosure, and destruction, organizations need to understand matters of compliance risk, which may result in fines or sanctions and may become public matters in some circumstances.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding applicable regulation and the selection of a security controls framework?

An appropriate framework will make it easier to map regulatory details to required activities.

It makes no difference which controls framework is selected for regulatory compliance matters.

Applicable laws and security control framework have little to do with each other.

For regulated organizations, wise selection of control frameworks will result in lower cyber-insurance premiums.

   A. Applicable regulations may or may not be specific to required activities. In some cases, control frameworks are available that closely resemble required activities. Selection of a control framework that corresponds to an applicable law or regulation may help an organization to better align regulatory requirements with required activities.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because there are cases where specific frameworks have coverage for specific regulations. For example, U.S. federal government agencies, as well as service providers that provide information-related services to one or more of those agencies, often follow NIST SP 800-53, as the controls in NIST SP 800-53 are required of these organizations. Similarly, organizations that manage credit card payment information often adopt PCI DSS as a control framework because they are specifically required to comply with all PCI DSS requirements. (Note that PCI DSS is not actually a law, but its position in the payments ecosystem gives it strong resemblance to a regulation.) C is incorrect since this blanket statement is not true. D is incorrect because the question is not addressing cyber-risk insurance.

In the use of FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk), how does a risk manager determine the potential types of loss?

A risk assessment is used to determine what types of loss may occur.

The record of prior losses is used.

Losses in similar companies are used.

Loss types are defined by the FAIR method.

   D. The FAIR analysis method contains six types of loss, which are productivity, response, replacement, fines and judgments, competitive advantage, and reputation. According to the FAIR method, any cybersecurity incident would result in one or more of these losses.

   A, B, and C are incorrect because the FAIR methodology does not employ these means. Instead, FAIR uses six types of loss: productivity, response, replacement, fines and judgments, competitive advantage, and reputation. The FAIR method does not accommodate any other types of loss.

Dawn, a CISO in a pharmaceutical organization, is partnering with the company’s legal department on the topic of new applicable regulations. Which of the following approaches is most likely to be successful?

Examine each new regulation for impact to the organization. Confirm applicability if impact is significant.

Examine each new regulation for impact to the organization. Confirm applicability for regulations from other countries.

Examine each new regulation for applicability. If applicable, analyze for impact to the organization.

Subscribe to a service that informs the organization of new laws. Implement them in the following budget year.

   C. Because there are so many regulations of different kinds, it is first necessary to determine which ones are applicable to the organization. For regulations that are applicable, the next best course of action is to understand the impact of the regulation on business processes and costs and then develop an action plan for complying with the regulation.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A and B are incorrect because these approaches will cause unnecessary burden on the organization. Regulations should first be vetted for applicability; if they are not applicable, no further work needs to be done. D is incorrect because this answer does not include the vital step of determining applicability. That said, a subscription service for new and emerging laws and regulations may be cost-effective for many organizations.

What steps must be completed prior to the start of a risk assessment in an organization?

A.   Determine the qualifications of the firm that will perform the audit.

Determine scope, purpose, and criteria for the audit.

Determine the qualifications of the person(s) who will perform the audit.

Determine the framework for reporting audit results.

   B. According to ISO/IEC 27005 and other risk management frameworks, it is first necessary to establish the context of an audit. This means making a determination of the scope of the audit—which parts of the organization are to be included. Also, it is necessary to determine the purpose of the risk assessment; for example, determining control coverage, control effectiveness, or business process effectiveness. Finally, the criteria for the audit need to be determined.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A and C are incorrect because any confirmation of qualifications would be determined prior to this point. D is incorrect because the framework for reporting results does not need to be completed prior to the start of the assessment.

Which of the following is not a risk management methodology?

Risk-IT

ISO/IEC 27005

NIST Special Publication 800-39

FAIR

   D. FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) is not a risk management framework, but a risk assessment methodology. Though closely related, a risk management framework is concerned with the outcomes of risk assessments, but not the performance of the risk assessments themselves.

   A, B, and C are incorrect because Risk-IT, ISO/IEC 27005, and NIST SP 800-39 are examples of risk management frameworks.

What is the primary objective of the Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) methodology?

Determine the probability of a threat event.

Determine the impact of a threat event.

Determine the cost of a threat event.

Determine the type of a threat event.

   A. The primary objective of FAIR is to determine the probability of an event using “what if” analysis, which cannot be easily done using maturity models or checklists.

   B, C, and D are incorrect because FAIR is not used to determine the impact, cost, or type of a threat or threat event.

A new CISO in a financial service organization is working to get asset inventory processes under control. The organization uses on-premises and IaaS-based virtualization services. What approach will most effectively identify all assets in use?

Perform discovery scans on all networks.

Obtain a list of all assets from the patch management platform.

C.   Obtain a list of all assets from the security information and event management system (SIEM).

Count all of the servers in each data center.

   A. Although none of these approaches is ideal, performing discovery scans on all networks is the best first step. Even so, it will be necessary to consult with network engineers to ensure that discovery scans will scan all known networks in on-premises and IaaS environments. Other helpful steps include interviewing system engineers to understand virtual machine management systems and obtain inventory information from them.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because patch management systems may not be covering all assets in the organization’s environment. C is incorrect because the SIEM may not be receiving log data from all assets in the organization’s environment. D is incorrect because the organization is using virtualization technology, as well as IaaS-based platforms; counting servers in an on-premises data center will fail to discover virtual assets and IaaS-based assets.

Russ, a security manager at a small online retailer, learned recently about the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The retailer has customers all over the world. The organization has outsourced its online catalog, order acceptance, and payment functions to a cloud-based e-commerce platform. Russ is unaware of any efforts that the retailer may have made to be compliant with GDPR. What should Russ do about this?

Ask senior management or the legal department about this matter.

Assume that the organization is compliant with GDPR.

Nothing, because the cloud-based e-commerce platform is required to be GDPR compliant.

Contact the cloud-based e-commerce platform and confirm its compliance to GDPR.

   A. A responsible security manager would always reach out to the legal department or another member of senior management to inquire about the organization’s state of compliance to a law or regulation.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because it is unwise to assume that others in an organization have all matters taken care of. C is incorrect because the retailer itself must be GDPR compliant, regardless of whether any part of its operations is outsourced. D is incorrect because the organization itself must be GDPR compliant. That said, the outsourcing organization must also be GDPR compliant.

Dylan is an executive security consultant who is assessing a client organization for compliance to various applicable information security and privacy regulations. Dylan has identified compliance issues and recommends that these issues be documented in the client organization’s business. How should these issues be documented?

A.   Separate entries for each regulation should be made in the organization’s risk register.

A single entry should be made in the organization’s risk register.

Separate entries for each regulation should be made in the organization’s security incident log.

A single entry should be made in the organization’s security incident log.

   B. The best way to document these findings is to create a single risk register entry for the matter. There could be dozens of similar issues that have common remedies, making it impractical to create potentially dozens of similar entries.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because there could be numerous similar entries that would create unnecessary clutter in the risk register. C and D are incorrect because the security incident log is not the best place to record this matter.

A security analyst has identified a critical server that is missing an important security-related operating system patch. What has the security analyst identified?

A vulnerability

A threat

A risk

An incident

   A. The security analysist has identified a vulnerability, which is a weakness that could more easily permit one or more types of threats to occur.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because the missing patch is not a threat, but a vulnerability that could permit a threat to occur. C is incorrect because this is not the most specific answer. D is incorrect because the missing patch is not an incident, although it may permit an incident to occur.

A security analyst has identified a new technique that cybercriminals are using to break into server operating systems. What has the security analyst identified?

A vulnerability

A threat

A risk

An incident

   B. The security analyst has identified a threat that, if realized, could result in an intrusion into the organization’s systems.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because these techniques are not a vulnerability, but a threat. C is incorrect because this is not the most specific answer. D is incorrect because the new technique is not an incident, although it might be possible for an incident to occur because of the threat.

Threat actors consist of all of the following except which one?

Trojans

Hacktivists

C.   Cybercriminal organizations

Employees

   A. Trojans are threats, but they are not threat actors. Threat actors consist of external parties such as hackers, cybercriminal organizations, hacktivists, and more; internal users are also considered threat actors in the context of “insider threat.”

   B, C, and D are incorrect because hacktivists, employees, and cybercriminals are all considered threat actors.

NotPetya is an example of what?

Threat

Spyware

Mass-mailing worm

Password-cracking tool

   A. NotPetya is a threat. More specifically, NotPetya is malware that resembles ransomware but lacks the ability to decrypt data; thus, it is considered by many to be destructware, or software that destroys data files.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because NotPetya is not spyware. C is incorrect because NotPetya is not a mass-mailing worm. D is incorrect because NotPetya is not a password cracker.

Which European law enforces users’ rights to privacy?

GLBA

GDPR

95/46/EC

SB-1386

   B. GDPR, or the European General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in 2018, provides several means to improve privacy for European residents.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because GLBA is a U.S. law that requires financial services organizations to protect information about its customers. C is incorrect because 95/46/EC, otherwise known as the European Privacy Directive, is the former European privacy law that has been superseded by GDPR. D is incorrect because SB-1386 is the original data breach disclosure law in the state of California.

Which mechanism does GDPR provide for multinational organizations to make internal transfers of PII?

Model clauses

Privacy Shield

Safe Harbor

Binding corporate rules

   D. Binding corporate rules were established by European privacy laws that permit multinational organizations to perform internal transfers of personally identifiable information (PII). Typically, this is applied to internal human resources information.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because model clauses are used between organizations to legally obligate them to comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations. B is incorrect because Privacy Shield was used by organizations to register their obligation to comply with GDPR. C is incorrect because Safe Harbor is the now-defunct means for organizations to register their obligation to comply with the former European privacy directive, 95/46/EC.

The internal audit department in a public company recently audited key controls in the vulnerability management process and found that the control “Production servers will be patched within 30 days of receipt of critical patches” fails 30 percent of the time. What finding should the internal audit make?

A new control is needed for vulnerability management.

The control is ineffective and needs to be corrected.

The control should be changed from 30 days to 45 days.

The control should be changed from 30 days to 21 days.

   B. There is a control in place that is not effective. The best remedy is to fix the existing control, which is still reasonable and appropriate.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because creating an additional control should not be considered until the existing control is fixed. C and D are incorrect because the SLA for critical patches does not necessarily need to be changed.

Upon examining the change control process in a SaaS provider organization, a new security manager has discovered that the change control process lacks a security impact procedure. What should the security management recommend for this matter?

Systems impacted by a change should be scanned before and after changes are made.

A post-change security review should be added to the change control process.

No change is needed because security is not needed in change control processes.

Add a security impact procedure to the change control process so that the security impact of each proposed change can be identified.

   D. The best remedy is the addition of a security impact procedure that is performed for each proposed change. This will help to identify any security-related issues associated with a proposed change that can be discussed prior to the change being made. This is preferable to the alternative: accepting a change that may have one or more security issues that may increase the risk of a security incident.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because not all security-related issues will be manifested in a vulnerability scan. B is incorrect because a security review should be performed prior to a change being made so that an organization can consider modifying the nature of the change so that there is no increase in risk. C is incorrect because security is an important consideration in a change control process.

The term “insider threat” includes all of the following except which one?

End users who are ignorant and make unwise decisions

Employees who have a grudge against their employer

Customers who attempt to break into systems while onsite

End users who are doing the right thing but make mistakes

   C. Customers, even while onsite, are not usually considered insiders.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. Each of these is considered an insider threat.

Examples of employees gone rogue include all of the following except which one?

A developer who inserts a time bomb in application source code

A securities trader who makes unauthorized trades resulting in huge losses

An engineer who locks co-workers out of the network because they are not competent

A systems engineer who applies security patches that cause applications to malfunction

   D. The systems engineer who applies patches to fix feature or security defects is the best choice, because there is little or no sign of malice. In this example, the change control process should be improved so that there is an opportunity to test software applications in a nonproduction environment prior to applying patches to production.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. Each of these is an example of an employee who has gone rogue and is consequently harming the organization.

Janice, a new CISO in a healthcare delivery organization, has discovered that virtually all employees are local administrators on their laptop/desktop computers. This is an example of what?

Insider threat

Vulnerability

Threat

Incident

   B. The matter of end users being local administrators means that they have administrative control of the computers they use, namely their laptop and/or desktop computers. This means they can install software and security patches and change the configuration of the operating system. This also means that malware introduced by the user onto the system will probably be able to run with administrative privileges, which may result in significantly more harm to the system and the organization.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because this configuration setting is not, by itself, an insider threat. However, an insider threat situation can be made worse through end users having local administrative privileges. C is incorrect because this is not a threat, but a vulnerability (these terms are often misused). D is incorrect because this is not an incident. However, an incident is somewhat more likely to occur and more likely to have greater impact because end users have local administrative privileges.

A campaign by a cybercriminal to perform reconnaissance on a target organization and develop specialized tools to build a long-term presence in the organization’s environment is known as what?

Watering hole attack

Hacktivism

Advanced persistent campaign (APC)

Advanced persistent threat (APT)

   D. A long-term campaign of patient reconnaissance, development of tools, and establishment of a long-term quiet presence inside an organization’s environment is known as an advanced persistent threat (APT). It is “advanced” on account of the reconnaissance and the development of an intrusion strategy with specialized tools; it is “persistent” by design, so that the intruder can maintain a long-term presence in the environment; it is a “threat” because the criminal actor is performing all of this to reach a long-term objective, whether the acquisition or destruction of sensitive information or the disruption of the organization’s operations.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because a watering hole attack is an attack on an organization via a compromised website that will automatically download malware onto visitors’ systems. B is incorrect because hacktivism refers to an ideology wherein an attacker seeks to expose or disrupt an organization for ideological reasons. C is incorrect because the term “advanced persistent campaign” is not in use.

Which of the following factors in risk analysis is the most difficult to determine?

Exposure factor

Single-loss expectancy

Event probability

Event impact

   C. Event probability is the most difficult of these values to determine accurately, particularly for high-impact, low-frequency events. Because event probability is so difficult to determine, much risk analysis work performed is qualitative in nature.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because exposure factor (which is calculated as a percentage of an asset’s value) is relatively easy to determine. B is incorrect because single-loss expectancy (which is calculated as asset value times exposure factor) is relatively easy to determine. D is incorrect because event impact (formally known as event cost) is not altogether difficult to determine.

An estimate on the number of times that a threat might occur in a given year is known as what?

Annualized loss expectancy (ALE)

Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO)

Exposure factor (EF)

Annualized exposure factor (AEF)

   B. Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) is defined as an estimate of the number of times that a threat will occur per year.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is defined as the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) times the single loss expectancy (SLE). C is incorrect as exposure factor (EF) is the loss that represents a percentage of an asset’s value (because in some cases, an asset is not completely destroyed). D is incorrect because there is no such term as annualized exposure factor (AEF).

Joel is a security manager in a large manufacturing company. The company uses primarily Microsoft, Cisco, and Oracle products. Joel subscribes to security bulletins from these three vendors. Which of the following statements best describes the adequacy of these advisory sources?

Joel should also subscribe to nonvendor security sources such as US-CERT and InfraGard.

Joel’s security advisory sources are adequate.

Joel should discontinue vendor sources and subscribe to nonvendor security sources such as US-CERT and InfraGard.

Joel should focus on threat hunting in the dark web.

   A. The best set of security advisories includes those from all IT product vendors, as well as a number of nonvendor sources such as US-CERT and InfraGard.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because Joel should also have at least one good nonvendor source such as US-CERT. C is incorrect because it is important to continue to receive vendor advisories. D is incorrect because “threat hunting on the dark web” is not a real activity.


   Q Questions
All of the following activities are typical inputs into a risk reporting process except which one?

Code reviews

Risk assessments

Threat assessments

Internal audits

   A. A code review is not a typical input to a risk reporting process, primarily because a code review represents a narrow, tactical examination of a program’s source code. Output from a code review would likely be fed into a software defect tracking process or a vulnerability management process.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. They are incorrect because risk assessments, threat assessments, and internal audits would typically result in issues being the subject of a risk reporting process. The distinction is this: A standard risk management and reporting process is designed to tackle cyber risks that are systemic in an organization. Examples of such risks include weaknesses in business processes and overarching design problems in complex information systems. Issues such as missing patches, security configuration problems, and software vulnerabilities are instead handled by tactical vulnerability management and software defect management processes.

What are possible outcomes of a risk that has been identified and analyzed in a risk management process?

Acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, transfer, residual

Acceptance, elimination, reduction, transfer

Acceptance, avoidance, elimination, mitigation, transfer

Acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, transfer

   D. The four possible outcomes of a risk in a risk management process are acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, and transfer. These are known as risk treatment options.

   A, B, and C are incorrect because these are not the outcomes of risk treatment in a risk management process. Elimination is not a valid risk treatment option because risks cannot be eliminated altogether. Residual is not a valid risk treatment option; instead, residual risk is defined as the “leftover” risk after the original risk has been reduced through mitigation or transfer.

Dawn, a new CISO in a pharmaceutical company, is reviewing an existing risk management process. The process states that the CISO alone makes all risk treatment decisions. What should Dawn conclude from this observation?

The process should be changed so that other business leaders may collaborate on risk treatment decisions.

The process is appropriate, as it is the CISO’s responsibility to make risk treatment decisions.

C.   The process should be changed so that the internal audit department approves risk treatment decisions.

The process should be changed so that external regulators approve risk treatment decisions.

   A. Risk treatment decisions are business decisions that should be made by business leaders in collaboration with the CISO. The CISO should not be making unilateral decisions on behalf of the business.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because the CISO should not be making unilateral decisions about risk on behalf of the business. Business leaders should at least participate in, and agree with, these decisions. C is incorrect because it is not appropriate for an internal audit department to make risk treatment decisions (except, possibly, for risk treatment decisions that are directly related to the internal audit function). D is incorrect because it is not appropriate for outside regulators to make an organization’s risk treatment decisions; at most, regulators may be informed of such decisions.

To what audience should communication about new information risks be sent?

Customers

Security steering committee and executive management

All personnel

Board of directors

   B. New developments concerning information risk should be sent to the information security steering committee and executive management. This is a part of a typical risk management process that includes risk communication.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because information risk matters are generally internal matters that are not shared with outside parties. Exceptions, of course, may include disclosures about risks and incidents as required by law, as well as through private legal obligations. C is incorrect because matters of information risk should not be shared to a wide audience such as all internal staff. D is incorrect because a board of directors does not necessarily need to know about all risks.

An internal audit team has completed a comprehensive internal audit and has determined that several controls are ineffective. What is the next step that should be performed?

Correlate these results with an appropriately scoped penetration test.

Develop compensating controls to reduce risk to acceptable levels.

Perform a risk assessment.

Develop a risk-based action plan to remediate ineffective controls.

   D. Typically, organizations are compelled to remediate most or all findings identified by an internal audit department. Taking a risk-based approach is sensible because this serves to remediate findings by addressing the highest-risk findings first.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because correlation with a penetration test would rarely be a prudent next step (unless the internal audit was solely focused on security configuration of target systems). B is incorrect because compensating controls are not the “go-to” remedy for curing control ineffectiveness; in some cases, compensating controls may be used, but this is not a typical approach. C is incorrect because a risk assessment does nothing to remediate control effectiveness findings.

A risk manager recently completed a risk assessment in an organization. Executive management asked the risk manager to remove one of the findings from the final report. This removal is an example of what?

Gerrymandering

Internal politics

Risk avoidance

Risk acceptance

   D. Although this is a questionable approach, removal of a risk finding in a report is, implicitly, risk acceptance. It could, however, be even worse than that, and in some industries, this could be considered negligent and a failure of due care. A risk manager should normally object to such an action and may consider documenting the matter or even filing a formal protest.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because the term “gerrymandering” is related to the formation of electoral districts in government. B is incorrect because, although the situation may be an example of internal politics, this is not the best answer. C is incorrect because risk avoidance is defined as a discontinuation of the activity related to the risk.

Ravila, a CISO, reports security-related metrics to executive management. The trend for the past several months for the metric “Percent of patches applied within SLA for servers supporting manufacturing” is 100 percent, 99.5 percent, 100 percent, 100 percent, 99.2 percent, and 74.5 percent. What action should Ravila take with regard to these metrics?

Explain that risk levels have dropped correspondingly.

No action is required because this is normal for patch management processes.

Investigate the cause of the reduction in patching and report to management.

Wait until the next month to see if the metric returns to normal.

   C. As patching is an important activity, and because the servers support critical business operations, this sudden drop in patch coverage needs to be investigated immediately and corrected as quickly as possible.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because a reduction in risk levels would not result in a decrease in patching. B is incorrect because the reduction in patch coverage is not a normal event. D is incorrect because it would be unwise to “wait and see” regarding such an important activity as server patching.

Duncan is the CISO in a large electric utility. Duncan received an advisory that describes a serious flaw in Intel CPUs that permits an attacker to take control of an affected system. Knowing that much of the utility’s industrial control system (ICS) is Intel-based, what should Duncan do next?

Report the situation to executive management.

Create a new entry in the risk register.

Analyze the situation to understand business impact.

Declare a security incident.

   C. Though it’s tempting to notify executive management immediately, without first understanding any potential business impact, there’s little to tell. For this reason, the best first step is to analyze the matter so that any business impact can be determined.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the impact is not yet known. B is incorrect because it is not the best answer. After understanding the matter, it may indeed be prudent to create a risk register entry, particularly if the matter is complicated and likely to persist for some time. D is incorrect because the impact of the advisory on the organization is not yet known. In some incident response plans, however, organizations may use advisories like this as a trigger for emergency analysis to take place.

Duncan is the CISO in a large electric utility. Duncan received an advisory that describes a serious flaw in Intel CPUs that permits an attacker to take control of an affected system. After analyzing the advisory and confirming that many of the ICS devices in the environment are Intel-based, what should Duncan do next?

Create a new entry in the risk register.

Report the situation to executive management.

Create a new entry in the vulnerability register.

Declare a security incident.

   B. Because the CISO has analyzed the advisory, the impact to the organization can be known. Duncan should report this matter to executive management and include an explanation of business impact and a remediation plan.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because this matter has greater urgency than the risk management life cycle is likely to provide. If, however, it is determined that there is no easy or quick fix, a risk register entry might be warranted. C is incorrect because it may be necessary to create many entries instead of a single entry. There may be many different types of devices that are affected by the advisory, necessitating an entry for each time, or an entry for each device, depending upon how the organization manages its vulnerabilities. D is incorrect because most organizations’ incident response plans do not address vulnerabilities, but actual threat realization events.

An internal audit of the employee termination process determined that in 20 percent of employee terminations, one or more terminated employee user accounts were not locked or removed. The internal audit department also found that formal monthly user access reviews identified 100 percent of missed account closures, resulting in those user accounts being closed no more than 60 days after users were terminated. What corrective actions, if any, are warranted?

Increase user access review process frequency to twice per week.

Increase user access review process frequency to weekly.

No action is necessary since a monthly user access review process is effective.

Improve the user termination process to reduce the number of missed account closures.

   D. The rate that user terminations are not performed properly is too high. Increasing the frequency of user access reviews will likely take too much time. The best remedy is to find ways of improving the user termination process. Since the “miss” rate is 20 percent, it is assumed that all processes are manual.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A and B are incorrect because the user access review process likely takes too much effort. Since the “miss” rate is 20 percent, it is assumed that all processes are manual. C is incorrect because the “miss” rate of 20 percent would be considered too high in most organizations. An acceptable rate would be under 2 percent.

Russ, a security manager at a small online retailer, is completing a self-assessment questionnaire for PCI DSS compliance. In studying the questionnaire, Russ has noted that his organization is not in compliance with all requirements. No auditor will be verifying the accuracy of the questionnaire. What is Russ’s best course of action?

Complete the form truthfully and notify senior management of the exceptions.

Complete the form truthfully and submit it to authorities.

Mark each control as compliant and submit it to authorities.

Mark each control as compliant and notify senior management that he must be truthful on the next such submission.

   A. Security professionals, particularly those who have industry certifications that have a code of conduct (including ISACA’s CISM certification), must be truthful, even when there may be personal, professional, or organizational consequences. In this situation, the form must be completed accurately, even though this means that the organization may have some short-term compliance issues with authorities.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because executive management should also be made aware of the compliance issue. C and D are incorrect because it would be unethical to falsify answers on the questionnaire.

While deliberating an item in an organization’s risk register, members of the cybersecurity steering committee have decided that the organization should discontinue a new feature in its online social media platform. This decision is an example of what?

Risk transfer

Risk acceptance

Risk mitigation

Risk avoidance

   D. Risk avoidance is one of four risk treatment options. In risk avoidance, the activity associated with an identified risk is discontinued.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. Risk transfer, risk acceptance, and risk mitigation are not the correct terms associated with the organization’s decision to discontinue the business activity discussed here.

The internal audit department in an organization recently audited the control “User accounts for terminated workers shall be locked or removed within 48 hours of termination” and found that user accounts for terminated workers are not locked or removed 20 percent of the time. What recommendation should internal audit make?

Change the timeframe in the control from 48 hours to 7 days.

Add a new compensating control for monthly review of terminated user accounts.

Add more staff to the team that manages user accounts.

No changes are needed since 20 percent is an acceptable failure rate.

   B. A compensating control in the form of a periodic access review is the best answer. Periodic access reviews are common and used for this purpose.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because seven days is far too long for user accounts to be active after a worker is terminated. C is incorrect because staffing levels are not necessarily the cause of this control failure. D is incorrect because 20 percent is considered too high a failure rate for a terminated user account access control.

A software as a service (SaaS) provider performs penetration tests on its services once per year, and many findings are identified each time. The organization’s CISO wants to make changes so that penetration test results will improve. The CISO should recommend all of the following changes except which one?

Add a security review of all proposed software changes into the SDLC.

Introduce safe coding training for all software developers.

Increase the frequency of penetration tests from annually to quarterly.

Include security and privacy requirements in the SDLC.

   C. Increasing the frequency of penetration tests is not likely to get to the root cause of the problem, which is the creation of too many security-related software defects.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the addition of a security review for proposed changes is likely to reveal issues that can be corrected prior to development. B is incorrect because safe coding training can help developers better understand coding practices that will result in fewer security defects. D is incorrect because the addition of security and privacy requirements will help better define the nature of new and changed features.

A SaaS provider performs penetration tests on its services once per year, and many findings are identified each time. What is the best way to report this matter to executive management?

Develop a KRI that reports the trend of security defects over time.

Penetration test reports should be distributed to executive management so that they can have a better understanding of the problem.

The executive summary section of penetration test reports should be distributed to executive management.

Report the number of defects found to executive management.

   A. A key risk indicator (KRI) should be developed that illustrates the risk that security defects pose to the organization. An example KRI for this situation could read, “Number of critical software defects introduced into SaaS Product.”

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because penetration test reports are quite detailed and technical, and they provide little, if any, business insight to an executive. C is incorrect because even an executive summary section in a penetration test report is unlikely to express business risk in a meaningful way. D is incorrect because the number of defects alone is not a good risk indicator.

A SaaS provider performs penetration tests on its services once per year, and many findings are identified each time. What is the best KRI that would highlight risks to executives?

Number of software vulnerabilities that exist on production SaaS applications

Number of days that critical software vulnerabilities exist on production SaaS applications

Number of vulnerability scans performed on production SaaS applications

Names of developers who introduced the greatest number of security defects into production SaaS applications

   B. The total number of days that unmitigated software defects existed on production applications is the best key risk indicator, particularly when tracked over a period of time.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the number of vulnerabilities alone does not sufficiently convey risk; a better depiction of risk is the number of days that unpatched vulnerabilities were present on production systems. C is incorrect because the number of scans does not provide an indication of risk. D is incorrect because a list of offenders is not a key risk indicator.

The security leader at a SaaS provider has noticed that the number of security defects in the SaaS application is gradually climbing over time to unacceptable levels. What is the best first step the security leader should take?

Contact the software development leader and report that more security defects are being created.

Initiate the procurement process for a web application firewall.

Initiate a low-severity security incident.

Create a new risk register entry that describes the problem along with potential fixes.

   D. When there is a disturbing trend developing, such as an increase in the number of security vulnerabilities being identified, creating an entry in the risk register is the best first step. This will facilitate action in the organization’s risk management process that will enable business and technology leaders to discuss the matter and make decisions to manage the risk.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because this is not the best first choice. Contacting the development leader is, however, a prudent move so that the development leader will not feel blindsided by later proceedings. B is incorrect because a WAF may not be the best solution here; besides, this represents a unilateral decision on the part of the security leader, when a better approach would be a discussion with stakeholders. C is incorrect because a situation like this is not commonly regarded as a security incident.

Which is the best method for reporting risk matters to senior management?

Sending after-action reviews of security incidents

Sending the outcomes of risk treatment decisions

Periodic briefing on the contents of the risk register

Sending memos each time a new risk is identified

   C. The best method available here is to provide a summary briefing on the contents of the risk register. Providing a summary overview of the items of the risk register will enable the leadership team to focus on the key areas or emerging risks that need their attention. This will help senior management better understand the entire catalog of unmanaged risks in the organization.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because risks often exist, apart from security incidents. B is incorrect because senior management should participate in risk treatment decisions, not merely be informed about them (implying that others are making those decisions). D is incorrect because sending memos is unstructured, and memos may not always be read. Further, a briefing from the risk register is much better, because this is an interactive event where senior management can ask questions about risks in the risk register.

Janice has worked in the Telco Company for many years and is now the CISO. For several years, Janice has recognized that the engineering organization contacts information security just prior to the release of new products and features so that security can be added in at the end. Now that Janice is the CISO, what is the best long-range solution to this problem?

Introduce security at the conceptual, requirements, and design steps in the product development process.

Train engineering in the use of vulnerability scanning tools so that they can find and fix vulnerabilities on their own.

Add security requirements to other requirements that are developed in product development projects.

There is no problem to fix: it is appropriate for engineering to contact security prior to product release to add in necessary security controls.

   A. The best long-term solution is the introduction of appropriate security activities throughout the product development life cycle, starting at the conceptual stage where new products and features are initially discussed. Security steps at the requirements and design stages will help ensure that products are secure by design.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because vulnerability scanning will fail to identify many types of security problems. C is incorrect because adding security requirements alone, while helpful, is not the best choice. D is incorrect because responsible organizations ensure that their products are secure by design.

Janice has worked in the Telco Company for many years and is now the CISO. For several years, Janice has recognized that the engineering organization contacts information security just prior to the release of new products and features so that security can be added in at the end. Now that Janice is the CISO, what is the best first step for Janice to take?

Initiate a low-severity security incident.

Create a new risk register entry that describes the problem along with potential fixes.

Initiate a high-severity security incident.

Write a memo to the leader of the engineering organization requesting that security be added to the product development life cycle.

   B. Creation of a risk register entry is the best first step. Presuming that a cross-functional cybersecurity council exists, the next step will be discussion of the matter that will lead to an eventual decision.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A and C are incorrect because initiation of a security incident is not an appropriate response. D is incorrect because a wider conversation should be conducted by cybersecurity steering committee members.

An end user in an organization opened an attachment in e-mail, which resulted in ransomware running on the end user’s workstation. This is an example of what?

Incident

Vulnerability

C.   Threat

Insider threat

   A. Ransomware executing on an end user’s workstation is considered an incident. It may have been allowed to execute because of one or more vulnerabilities.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because a vulnerability is a configuration setting or a software defect that can, if exploited, result in an incident. C is incorrect because ransomware, by itself, is considered a threat, but ransomware executing on a system is considered an incident. D is incorrect because this is not considered an insider threat. However, users having poor judgment (which may include clicking on phishing messages) is considered an insider threat.

Joel, a CISO in a manufacturing company, has identified a new cybersecurity-related risk to the business and is discussing it privately with the chief risk officer (CRO). The CRO has asked Joel not to put this risk in the risk register. What form of risk treatment does this represent?

This is not risk treatment, but the avoidance of managing the risk altogether.

This is risk avoidance, where the organization elects to avoid the risk altogether.

This is risk transfer, as the organization has implicitly transferred this risk to insurance.

This is risk acceptance, as the organization is accepting the risk as-is.

   A. The deliberate “burying” of a risk is not risk treatment, but the refusal to deal with the risk altogether. Although there may be legitimate reasons for this action, based on the information here, there is an appearance of negligence or a coverup on the part of the CRO.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because risk avoidance is a formal decision wherein the organization will discontinue the activity that manifests the identified risk. C is incorrect because there is no indication in this question that cyber insurance will assume this risk. D is incorrect because formal risk acceptance involves the use of the risk management life cycle that includes the risk being recorded in the risk ledger, followed by analysis and a risk treatment decision.

Which is the best method for prioritizing risks and risk treatment?

Threat event probability times asset value, from highest to lowest

Threat event probability, followed by asset value

Professional judgment

A combination of threat event probability, asset value, and professional judgment

   D. The best method for prioritizing risks and risk treatment is to examine the probability of event occurrence (difficult though that may be), asset value, and impact to the organization. Professional judgment plays a big role as well because factors such as business reputation are difficult to quantify.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because this approach allows no room for professional judgment. B is incorrect because there is no logical sequence based on these two items that are measured differently. C is incorrect because professional judgment alone risks the failure to consider high-value assets, high impact, and high probability of occurrence.

A security leader recently commissioned an outside company to assess the organization’s performance against the NIST SP 800-53 control framework to see which controls the organization is operating properly and which controls require improvement. Who should decide which controls will be improved?

CIO

CISO

Business unit leaders

The outside company

   C. Decisions to remediate risks are a risk treatment activity. Risk treatment decisions are typically made by risk owners, usually business unit leaders, with consultation from the security leader.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A and B are incorrect because the CIO and CISO are rarely the parties to make risk treatment decisions. D is incorrect because the outside company should not be making risk treatment decisions for the organization.

An organization’s information security department conducts quarterly user access reviews of the financial accounting system. Who is the best person to approve users’ continued access to roles in the system?

Security manager

IT manager

Corporate controller

Users’ respective managers

   C. The best person to approve ongoing user access in an application is a business unit leader or department head or someone in the business responsible for the business process(es) supported by the information system.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the security manager is not going to be as familiar with finance department operations to know which persons should continue to have access to roles. B is incorrect because the IT manager is not going to be as familiar with finance department operations to know which persons should continue to have access to roles. D is incorrect because users’ managers are not going to be as familiar with finance department operations to know which persons should continue to have access to roles.

Which of the following is the best description of risk treatment?

Adding a risk to the risk register

Assigning a risk to a business unit leader or department head

Reducing a risk through mitigation

Deciding what to do about the risk

   D. Risk treatment is best described as a decision on what to do about a particular risk. The choices are to accept the risk, mitigate the risk, transfer the risk, or avoid the risk.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because adding a risk to the risk register is not a description of risk treatment. B is incorrect because assigning a risk to someone is not a description of risk treatment. C is incorrect because risk reduction is not a description of risk treatment, but instead is one of the possible choices of a risk treatment decision.

A risk analyst is studying a risk and its risk profile after a risk treatment decision of mitigation was made. The analyst has determined that mitigation does not eliminate all of the risk, but only a part of the risk. How should the risk analyst proceed?

Reject the risk treatment plan.

Record the leftover risk.

Inform management that the risk treatment plan is incomplete.

Do nothing.

   B. After risk treatment, there is often leftover risk, known as residual risk, that is usually entered into the risk register as a new risk to be analyzed and treated.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because risk treatment rarely eliminates all risk. C is incorrect because management is likely aware of the existence of residual risk. D is incorrect because doing nothing would amount to ignoring the residual risk, which should be recorded.

Which of the following persons is most suitable for owning a control related to access to a business application?

Head of the department that uses the application

IT service desk

Security manager

IT leader

   A. The most suitable choice for a control owner related to access to a business application is the head of the department that uses the application. This person will decide who should have access to the application and with what roles.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because the IT service desk, even if they provision access to the system, should not be considered the control owner, because the IT service desk is ill-suited to make access decisions. C is incorrect because the security manager often will not know which persons should have access to the application. D is incorrect because the IT leader should not be making business decisions regarding who should have access to a business application.

An organization recently commissioned an outside security company to perform a risk assessment. Each of the risks identified in the assessment report are to be added to the risk register. Who should be the owner of each of these new risks?

The board of directors

The security manager

Department heads

The outside security company

   C. Risk ownership is best assigned to department heads and business unit owners associated with the business activity where the risk exists.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because a board of directors is seldom assigned as a risk owner. B is incorrect because security managers and security leaders, including the CISO, are seldom assigned as a risk owner. D is incorrect because the company performing the risk assessment is not a part of the organization.

Which of the following categories of risk would be reported to a board of directors?

All of the following

Process-level risks

Asset-level risks

Risks in the ERM risk register

   D. Of the available choices, risks present in the ERM (enterprise risk management) risk register would be reported to a board of directors.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A and C are incorrect because process-level risks and asset-level risks would not normally be reported to a board of directors, as this is an excessive amount of detail. B is incorrect because reporting ERM-level risks is a better choice than reporting process-level risks.
