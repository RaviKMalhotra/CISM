Q Questions
Which of the following best describes information security governance?

Information security policies

Information security policies along with audits of those policies

Management’s control of information security processes

Benchmarks of metrics as compared to similar organizations

   C. ISACA defines governance as a set of processes that “[e]nsures that stakeholder needs, conditions and options are evaluated to determine balanced, agreed-on enterprise objectives to be achieved; setting direction through prioritization and decision making; and monitoring performance and compliance against agreed-on direction and objectives.”

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because, although information security policies are an essential part of information security governance, there are several other components to governance as well. B is incorrect because security policies and activities (such as audits) to measure their effectiveness are only one component of information security governance. D is incorrect because the comparison of metrics to other organizations is not a significant part of a governance program. Indeed, many organizations forego benchmarking entirely.

In a risk management process, who is the best person(s) to make a risk treatment decision?

Chief risk officer (CRO)

Chief information officer (CIO)

Process owner who is associated with the risk

Chief information security officer (CISO)

   C. The department head (or division head or business owner, as appropriate) associated with the business activity regarding the risk treatment decision should be the person making the risk treatment decision. This is because a risk treatment decision is a business decision that should be made by the person who is responsible for the business function.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the chief risk officer (CRO) should not be making business function risk decisions on behalf of department heads or business owners. At best, the CRO should be facilitating discussions leading to risk treatment decisions. B is incorrect because the CIO should not be making business function risk decisions on behalf of department heads or business owners. D is incorrect because the CISO should not be making risk treatment decisions. Instead, the CISO should, at best, be facilitating discussions that lead to risk treatment decisions made by department heads or business owners.

The ultimate responsibility for an organization’s cybersecurity program lies with whom?

The board of directors

The chief executive officer (CEO)

The chief information officer (CIO)

The chief information security officer (CISO)

   A. The ultimate responsibility for everything in an organization, including its cybersecurity program, lies with its board of directors. Various laws and regulations define board member responsibilities, particularly in publicly traded organizations in the United States and in other countries.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect, except in unusual cases when an organization does not have a board of directors. C is incorrect because this is about ultimate responsibility, which lies with the board of directors. D is incorrect because the CISO’s role should be one of a facilitator, wherein other members of executive management, as well as board members, make business decisions (including cybersecurity-related decisions) on behalf of the organization.

In a U.S. public company, a CISO will generally report the state of the organization’s cybersecurity program to:

The Treadway Commission

Independent auditors

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

The audit committee of the board of directors

   D. In most U.S. publicly traded companies, the CISO will report the state of the organization’s cybersecurity program to members of the audit committee of the board of directors. Although this is the best answer, in some organizations, the CIO or CEO may instead report on the cybersecurity program.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because an organization would not report anything to the Treadway Commission. B is incorrect because the CISO would typically not report the state of the cybersecurity program to independent auditors. In public companies, however, the CISO and independent auditors will periodically meet to discuss the cybersecurity program. C is incorrect because the CISO would not be reporting to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). An organization’s internal auditor or CFO will, however, submit reports about the organization’s financial results to the SEC, although these filings will rarely include information about cybersecurity, unless there has been a security incident that had material impact on the organization.

A new CISO in an organization is building its cybersecurity program from the ground up. To ensure collaboration among business leaders and department heads in the organization, the CISO should form and manage which of the following?

A risk committee of the board of directors

A cybersecurity steering committee

An audit committee of the board of directors

Business-aligned security policy

   B. A cybersecurity steering committee, consisting of senior executives, business unit leaders, and department heads, when properly facilitated by the CISO, can discuss organization-wide issues related to cybersecurity and make strategic decisions about cyber risk.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the CISO will not be involved in the formation and management of a board of directors risk committee. C is incorrect because a CISO would not be involved in the formation or management of a board of directors audit committee. D is incorrect because a business-aligned security policy, while important, would not significantly foster collaboration among business leaders.

Who is the best person or group to make cyber-risk treatment decisions?

The chief information security officer (CISO)

The audit committee of the board of directors

The cybersecurity steering committee

The chief risk officer (CRO)

   C. The cybersecurity steering committee, which should consist of senior executives, business unit leaders, and department heads, should openly discuss, collaborate, and decide on most risk treatment issues in an organization. If decisions are made by individuals such as the CISO or CRO, then business leaders may be less likely to support those decisions, as they may not have had a part in decision-making.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the CISO unilaterally making risk treatment decisions for the organization is less likely to get buy-in from other business leaders, who may feel they did not have a voice in making these decisions. B is incorrect because audit committee members rarely get involved in risk treatment decision-making. D is incorrect because the CRO unilaterally making risk treatment decisions will result in less buy-in and support from business leaders than if they participated in these decisions.

Which is the best party to conduct access reviews?

Users’ managers

Information security manager

IT service desk

Department head

   D. The persons who are responsible for business activities should be the ones who review users’ access to applications that support their business activities. All too often, however, access reviews are performed by persons less qualified to make decisions about which persons should have access (and at what levels or capabilities) to systems and applications critical to their business processes. Commonly, IT personnel perform these reviews as a proxy for business owners, but often IT personnel do not have as much knowledge about business operations and are, therefore, less qualified to make quality decisions about user access. IT personnel can perform a user access review only if they have a sound understanding of user roles; but even then, business owners should be informed of user access reviews and their outcomes.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because the managers of users with access to systems and applications are not the best parties to review access. B is incorrect because information security managers have insufficient knowledge about business operations and the persons using them. C is incorrect because IT service desk personnel have insufficient knowledge about business operations and the persons using them. More often, IT service personnel are the ones who carry out access changes. Since they are the ones carrying out changes (in most cases), they should not also be the party reviewing who has access, because they would be reviewing their own work.

Which is the best party to make decisions about the purpose and function of business applications?

Business department head

IT business analyst

Application developer

End user

   A. As the party who is responsible for the ongoing operations and success of business operations and business processes, a business department head is the best party to determine the behavior of business applications supporting business processes.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because IT business analysts are not responsible for decisions about business unit operations. That said, the IT business analyst’s role may include facilitation of discussions concerning the configuration and function of business applications, and in some cases, he or she may make configuration changes. C is incorrect because application developers are not responsible for decisions about business unit operations. In some cases, however, application developers may have intimate knowledge of the internal workings of business applications and may provide insight into the function of applications. Thus, they may provide information in support of decisions made by business department heads. D is incorrect because end users are generally not responsible for decisions about business unit operations.

Which of the following is the best definition of custodial responsibility?

A custodian protects assets based on the customer’s defined interests.

A custodian protects assets based on the custodian’s own defined interests.

A custodian makes decisions based on the custodian’s own defined interests.

A custodian makes decisions based on the customer’s defined interests.

   D. A custodian is charged with a potentially wide range of decisions regarding the care of an asset. Decisions are based upon the customer’s defined interests. A germane example is an IT department that builds and maintains information systems on behalf of internal customers; the IT department will make various decisions about the design and operation of an information system so that the system will best meet customers’ needs.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because protection of an asset is only a part of the scope of responsibility of a custodian. B is incorrect because a custodian does not protect assets based on the custodian’s own interests, but rather on the customer’s interest. C is incorrect because a custodian does not make decisions based on the custodian’s own interests, but rather on the customer’s interest.

What is the primary risk of IT acting as custodian for a business owner?

IT may not have enough interest to provide quality care for business applications.

IT may not have sufficient staffing to care for business applications properly.

IT may have insufficient knowledge of business operations to make good decisions.

Business departments might not give IT sufficient access to manage applications properly.

   C. IT personnel tend to focus their thoughts on the technology supporting business departments rather than on the business operations occurring in the business departments they support. Often, IT departments are observed to make too many assumptions about the needs of their customers, and they do not work hard enough to understand their users’ needs to ensure that business applications will support them properly.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A and B are incorrect because they are not the best answers regarding the primary risk of IT acting as custodian for a business owner. D is incorrect because business units are not generally in a position to restrict IT departments from administrative access to business applications.

An organization needs to hire an executive who will build a management program that will consider threats and vulnerabilities and determine controls needed to protect systems and work centers. What is the best job title for this position?

CSO

CRO

CISO

CIRO

   B. The CRO (chief risk officer) is responsible for managing risk for multiple types of assets, commonly information assets, as well as physical assets and/or workplace safety. In financial services organizations, the CRO will also manage risks associated with financial transactions or financial asset portfolios.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the CSO (chief security officer) is not necessarily responsible for risk management, but is instead responsible for the design, deployment, and operation of protective controls, commonly for information systems as well as other assets such as equipment or work centers. C is incorrect because the CISO (chief information security officer) is typically responsible for protection of only information assets and not other types of assets such as property, plant, and equipment. D is incorrect because the CIRO (chief information risk officer) is typically responsible for risk management and protection of information assets but not other types of assets, such as property, plant, and equipment.

An organization needs to hire an executive who will be responsible for ensuring that the organization’s policies, business processes, and information systems are compliant with laws and regulations concerning the proper collection, use, and protection of personally identifiable information. What is the best job title for the organization to use for this position?

CSO

CIRO

CISO

CPO

   D. The chief privacy officer (CPO) is the best title for a position in which the executive ensures that the organization’s policies, practices, controls, and systems ensure the proper collection, use, and protection of personally identifiable information (PII).

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because the chief security officer (CSO) is typically not responsible for privacy-related activities concerning the collection and use of PII. B is incorrect because the chief information risk officer (CIRO) is typically not responsible for privacy-related activities concerning the collection and use of PII. C is incorrect because the chief information security officer (CISO) is typically not responsible for privacy-related activities concerning the collection and use of PII.

The Big Data Company is adjusting several position titles in its IT department to reflect industry standards. Included in consideration are two individuals: The first is responsible for the overall relationships and data flows among its internal and external information systems. The second is responsible for the overall health and management of systems containing information. Which two job titles are most appropriate for these two roles?

Systems architect and database administrator

Data architect and data scientist

Data scientist and database administrator

Data architect and database administrator

   D. Data architect is the best position title for someone who is responsible for the overall relationships and data flows among the organization’s information systems. Database administrator (DBA) is the best position title for someone who is responsible for maintaining the database management systems (DBMSs) throughout the organization.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because systems architect is not the best title for someone who is responsible for the overall relationships and data flows among the organization’s information systems. B is incorrect because data scientist is not the best title for someone who is responsible for the overall health and management of systems containing information. C is incorrect because data scientist is not the best title for someone who is responsible for the overall relationships and data flows among its internal and external information systems.

What is the primary distinction between a network engineer and a telecom engineer?

A network engineer is primarily involved with networks and internal network media, while a telecom engineer is primarily involved with networks and external (carrier) network media.

A network engineer is primarily involved with networks and external (carrier) network media, while a telecom engineer is primarily involved with networks and internal network media.

A network engineer is primarily involved with layer 3 protocols and above, while a telecom engineer is primarily involved with layer 1 and layer 2 protocols.

There is no distinction, as both are involved in all aspects of an organization’s networks.

   A. A network engineer is primarily involved with networks and internal network media (including cabling and internal wireless networks such as Wi-Fi), while a telecom engineer is primarily involved with networks and external (carrier) network media such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Frame Relay, and dark fiber in support of services such as data transport, phone systems, conferencing systems, and voicemail systems.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because the definitions in this answer are swapped. C is incorrect because the distinction between a network engineer and a telecom engineer is not strictly about protocol layers. D is incorrect because there is a distinction between the network engineer and telecom engineer position titles.

An organization that is a U.S. public company is redesigning its access management and access review controls. What is the best role for internal audit in this redesign effort?

Develop procedures

Design controls

Provide feedback on control design

Develop controls and procedures

   C. Any internal audit function should not design or implement controls or procedures other than those in their own department. Internal audit cannot play a design role in any process or control that it may later be required to audit.

   A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because internal audit should not develop procedures that it may later be required to audit. Instead, internal audit can provide feedback on procedures developed by others. Internal audit can never be in a position to audit its own work. B is incorrect because internal audit should not design controls that it may later be required to audit. Internal audit can provide feedback on controls designed by others. Internal audit can never be in a position to audit its own work. D is incorrect because internal audit should not develop controls or procedures. This is because internal audit may be required to audit these controls and/or procedures; internal audit can never be in a position to audit its own work.

A security operations manager is proposing that engineers who design and manage information systems play a role in monitoring those systems. Are design and management compatible with monitoring? Why or why not?

Personnel who design and manage systems should not perform a monitoring role because this is a conflict of interest.

Personnel who design and manage systems will be more familiar with the reasons and steps to take when alerts are generated.

Personnel who design and manage systems will not be familiar with response procedures when alerts are generated.

Personnel who design and manage systems are not permitted access to production environments and should not perform monitoring.

   B. Personnel who design and manage information systems are more likely to be familiar with the nature of alerts as well as procedures for responding to them.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because there would normally not be any conflict of interest between design, management, and monitoring. C is incorrect because personnel who design and manage information systems are in a position to understand how those systems work and would be more likely to know how to respond to alerts. D is incorrect because personnel who manage information systems would be permitted to access them in production environments.

The statement “Complete migration of flagship system to latest version of vendor-supplied software” is an example of what?

Mission statement

Vision statement

Purpose statement

Objective statement

   D. The statement is a strategic objective.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because the statement is too specific to be a mission statement. B is incorrect because the statement is not typical of a vision statement. C is incorrect because the statement is not typical of a purpose statement.

Ernie, a CISO who manages a large security group, wants to create a mission statement for the CISO group. What is the best approach for creating this mission statement?

Start with the organization’s mission statement.

Start with Ernie’s most recent performance review.

Start with the results of the most recent risk assessment.

Start with the body of open items in the risk register.

   A. The best way to manage a security organization is to align it with the business it is supporting. When creating a security organization mission statement, a good start is to look at the overall organization’s mission statement; this way, the security team’s mission is more likely to align with the overall organization. If the overall organization lacks a mission statement, the CISO can use what he or she knows about the organization’s purpose to build a security team mission statement that is sure to support the organization.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because it is not the best answer. Still, it is possible that the CISO’s performance review may be well aligned with the overall business and may be a useful reference for creating a CISO team mission statement. C is incorrect because, by itself, a risk assessment report, though it may be an indicator of the nature of the work that the CISO organization may be undertaking in the future, will not provide much information about the overall business’s purpose. D is incorrect because the risk register’s open items will not provide much information about the organization’s overall purpose. Although the risk register’s open items may be an indicator of the types of work that the CISO organization will be working on, this does not provide sufficient information to develop the CISO organization’s mission, because the CISO’s mission is more than just solving short-term problems.

Samuel is the CISO in an organization that is a U.S. public company. Samuel has noted that the organization’s internal audit function concentrates its auditing efforts on “financially relevant” applications and underlying IT systems and infrastructure. As an experienced CISO, what conclusion can Samuel draw from this?

The audits performed by internal audit on underlying IT systems and infrastructure are value-added activities.

Internal audit’s scope is too narrow and must include all applications and IT systems.

The scope of internal audit is of no consequence or value to the CISO.

The scope of internal audit’s auditing activities is as expected for a U.S. public company.

   D. In a U.S. public company, an internal audit function is required to audit the financially relevant business processes and their supporting business applications and IT infrastructure to provide reasonable assurances about the integrity of financial reports produced by the organization to its shareholders. This is required because in 2002, Congress passed the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) to protect shareholders and the general public from accounting errors and fraudulent practices in enterprises and to improve the accuracy of corporate disclosures. The act sets deadlines for compliance and publishes rules on requirements.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because internal audits in a U.S. public company are required to audit the systems and infrastructures that support financially relevant business applications. This is not a value-added (not required) activity. B is incorrect because internal audit is not required to audit all of an organization’s applications and IT systems. However, in some organizations, internal audit’s scope surpasses what is required of U.S. public companies to provide assurances of the integrity of other processes and systems. C is incorrect because internal audit would be considered a business partner of a CISO in most organizations. This is because internal audit analyzes security controls in parts of IT, and this provides the CISO with valuable information on the effectiveness of at least some of the security controls in the organization.

What is the purpose of metrics in an information security program?

To measure the performance and effectiveness of security controls

To measure the likelihood of an attack on the organization

To predict the likelihood of an attack on an organization

To predict the method of an attack on an organization

   A. The purpose of metrics is to measure the performance and effectiveness of security controls. The meaning and usefulness of specific metrics will depend upon the context and measurement method of specific controls.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because metrics do not necessarily foretell of an attack on an organization. C is incorrect because metrics are not always used to predict an attack on an organization. D is incorrect because metrics do not necessarily predict the method used for an attack on an organization.

Of what value is a third-party risk management (TPRM) process for a CISO who is developing a long-term security strategy for an organization?

TPRM provides valuable insight into the security capabilities of critical service providers.

TPRM provides valuable insight into the organization’s procurement process.

TPRM provides a list of all service providers used by the organization.

TPRM does not provide value to the CISO because it is concerned only with business processes.

   A. An effective TPRM program captures and archives detailed information about security controls in third-party service-provider organizations. This helps a CISO better understand the overall world of risk with regard to the protection of critical data and capabilities.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because TPRM provides little, if any, insight into procurement. This is because TPRM does not include activities such as competitive analysis, suitability of services, or pricing, which are among the matters of focus by procurement. C is incorrect because a TPRM process does not necessarily provide a list of all of an organization’s service providers. This is because individuals and groups may still procure low-cost or free services and “fly under the radar” of IT, security, legal, and procurement processes and put the organization at risk. D is incorrect because a TPRM process focuses on information security risk in third-party service-provider organizations, which is a high-value concern for a CISO.

Joseph, a new security leader in an online retail organization, is developing a long-term security strategy. Joseph has developed a detailed description of the future state of the security organization. What must Joseph do before developing a strategy to realize the future state?

Perform an audit of existing security controls to understand their effectiveness.

Understand the current state and perform a gap analysis to identify the differences.

Perform a risk assessment to identify potential pitfalls in the strategy.

Commission a penetration test to identify unknown vulnerabilities in critical systems.

   B. When developing a strategy, it is first necessary to develop the desired end state, understand the current state, and understand the gaps between the two. The strategy, then, will consist of work required to close those gaps, transforming the organization into the desired end state.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because, although it is important to perform audits of controls to understand their effectiveness, this question is focused on the proper method for developing a strategy: develop the desired end state, determine the current state, and perform a gap analysis to determine the work required to realize the end state. C is incorrect because, although it is important to perform risk assessments, this question is focused on the proper method for developing a strategy: develop the desired end state, determine the current state, and perform a gap analysis to determine the work required to realize the end state. D is incorrect because, although it is important to perform penetration tests to identify potentially critical vulnerabilities in information systems and applications, this question is focused on the proper method for developing a strategy: develop the desired end state, determine the current state, and perform a gap analysis to determine the work required to realize the end state.

Joseph, a new security leader in an online retail organization, is developing a long-term security strategy. In his research, Joseph is seeking documents describing the current security program. Which of the following documents would not provide the best value in this analysis?

Security program charter

Security team job descriptions

Information security policy

Meeting minutes for the cybersecurity steering committee

   B. Of these four sets of information, job descriptions for security team members would provide the least valuable insight. In part this is because workers’ regular activities sometimes stray away from statements in a job description. At best, a job description describes desired or expected activities at a point in time in the past.

   A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because a security program charter would provide considerable insight into the mission and vision for an information security program. C is incorrect because an information security policy would provide insight into the security-related expectations in an organization. That said, a security leader would need to explore the policy further to determine the degree of compliance. D is incorrect because meeting minutes for a cybersecurity steering committee are of potentially high value to a security leader. This, of course, depends upon the purpose of the steering committee and the nature of its proceedings and decisions.

Quincy is a security leader who wants to formalize information security in his organization. What is the best first step to formalizing the program?

Start an information security intranet site.

Start an information security newsletter.

Develop an information security policy.

Develop an information security program charter.

   D. An information security program charter describes the mission and vision for an information security program, defines roles and responsibilities, and describes its engagement with others in the organization as well as external parties such as customers or regulators.

   A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because, although an intranet site can help others in the organization be better informed about the information security program, a charter is the best choice. B is incorrect because, although a newsletter can help others in the organization be better informed about the information security program, a charter is the best choice. C is incorrect because an organization needs to have an information security policy, whether its information security program is formal or not.

Ravila, a security leader, has assessed the maturity of the information security capabilities in the organization using the CMMI model. The average maturity of business processes in the organization is 3.2. What should Ravila do next?

Compare the current maturity levels to desired maturity levels and develop a strategy to achieve desired levels.

Determine the steps necessary to raise process maturity to 5.

Identify the processes with the lowest maturity and develop a strategy to raise them to the level of other processes.

Perform a root cause analysis (RCA) to determine why business process maturity has fallen to this level.

   A. The best answer here is to determine any gaps between current and future maturity levels so that any processes needing improvement can be improved and measured.

   B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because level 5 is not necessarily a realistic goal for maturity in an organization. An average maturity between 2.5 and 4 is acceptable and appropriate in many organizations. C is incorrect because it is normal and acceptable for some processes to have lower maturity levels than others. D is incorrect because there is no indication here that the maturity of any processes has declined. RCA, however, may be a reasonable activity to undertake if the maturity of a specific process has declined in order to understand how to mitigate it.
